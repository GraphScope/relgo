\revisewy{The recent ISO SQL:2023 standard adopts SQL/PGQ (Property Graph Queries), facilitating graph-like querying within relational databases. This advancement, however, underscores a significant gap in how to effectively optimize SQL/PGQ queries within relational database systems. To address this gap, we extend the foundational} \spj (Select-Project-Join) queries to \spjm queries, which include an additional matching operator for representing graph pattern matching in SQL/PGQ. Although \spjm queries can be converted to \spj queries and optimized using existing relational query optimizers, our analysis shows that such a graph-agnostic method fails to benefit from graph-specific optimization techniques found in the literature. To address this issue, we develop a converged relational/graph optimization framework called \name for optimizing \spjm queries, leveraging joint efforts from both relational and graph query optimizations. Using DuckDB as the underlying relational execution engine, our experiments demonstrate that \name can generate efficient execution plans for \spjm queries. On well-established benchmarks, these plans exhibit an average speedup of $14.72\times$ compared to those produced by the graph-agnostic optimizer.
    %Besides, experimental results on micro benchmarks illustrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization strategies.
    %Additionally, experimental results from micro-benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization strategies. In particular, by applying constraints directly within the matching operators, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 600 times. Moreover, eliminating fusion or using \texttt{expandintersect} can at least double the execution time of the generated plans.
    %Besides, the experimental results of ablation studies illustrate the efficiency of \expandintersect.
