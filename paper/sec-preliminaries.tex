\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

\subsection{Data Model}
Let $L$ be a finite set of labels, $D = \bigcup_i D_i$ be the union of atomic domains $D_i$, and $\epsilon$ be the \kw{NULL} value. We define a \textit{property graph} as $G = (V, E, \lambda, L, T, \vlabel, \elabel, P_v, P_e)$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is a finite set of vertices,
    \item $E$ is a finite set of edges,
    \item $\lambda: E \mapsto V \times V$ connects each edge $e$ with a tuple $(s, t)$ of source and target vertices,
    \item $\vlabel: V \mapsto 2^L$ assigns a set of labels to each vertex,
    \item $\elabel: E \mapsto T$ assigns a type to each edge,
    \item $P_v$ is a set of vertex properties, where $p_v^i: V \mapsto D_i \cup \{\epsilon\}$ is a partial function that assigns a property value in $D_i$ to each vertex. 
    In particular, if a vertex $v$ does not have the property $p_v^i$, $p_v^i(v) = \epsilon$,
    \item $P_e$ is a set of edge properties, where $p_e^j: E \mapsto D_j \cup \{\epsilon\}$ is a partial function that assigns a property value in $D_j$ to each edge. 
    In particular, if an edge $e$ does not have the property $p_e^j$, $p_e^j(e) = \epsilon$.
\end{itemize}

Let $U = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ be a finite set of attributes, then $S = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ is called a schema over $U$. 
The attributes of $S$ is denoted as $\attr(R) = U$. The value of each attribute $a \in \attr(S)$ comes from specific domain, denoted as $\Dom(a)$.
Let $\mathcal{J} = 2^{V \times E \times D}$ be the domain of the sets of records, $\mathcal{J}_D = 2^{D}$ be the domain of the sets of records whose attributes are not vertices or edges. 

Given a property graph $G$, a graph schema is such a schema $S$ that $\forall a \in \attr(S)$, $\Dom(a) \subseteq V \cup E \cup D$. 
In other words, each attribute of a graph schema is either a vertex, or an edge, or data from arbitrary domain. 
A relation $R$ over a graph schema $S$ (i.e. $\sch(R) = S$) is called a graph relation. 
For simplicity, we denote $\attr(R)$ in short for $\attr(S)$ with $\sch(R) = S$ to retrieve the attributes of a graph relation $R$. 
We write $R.a$ to access a given attribute $a$ in the relation $R$. 

Given a graph relation $R$, if $a \in \attr(R) \subseteq V \cup E$, we can further access the property $p$ on the vertex/edge attribute via $p(R.a)$ (or $p(a)$ if the relation $R$ is clear in the context). 
Particularly, we use $\id$ and $\lab$/$\type$ to denote the built-in properties of the globally unique identifier and label/type of a vertex/edge. 
To clarify ambiguity, the term ``attribute'' always refers to the attribute of a relation, while the term ``property'' always refers to the property of a graph element in this article.


\subsection{Graph Relational Algebra}
\label{sec:graph-relational-algebra}

In this paper, we extend the graph relational algebra for openCypher proposed in \cite{}.
The graph relational algebra utilizes graph relations as its outputs, and consists of operators for graph relations, such as selection ($\sigma$), projection ($\pi$), natural join ($\Join$), left-outer join ($\leftouterjoin$), get-vertices ($\bigcirc$), expand ($\updownarrow^{(w:L)}_{(v)}[e](r)$), and unwind ($\omega$).
Graph relations default apply the \emph{bag} semantics, and assume no order for the relation unless an explicit \emph{sorting} operator is applied.
In this subsection, these operators in graph relational algebra are first introduced with examples.


\subsubsection{Source}
The source operator gets vertices from a graph according to the constraints specified on the labels of the vertices.

\begin{definition}
    The source operator $\bigcirc_{(v:l_1, \cdots, l_k)}$ gets a set of vertices from the graph.
    Each obtained vertex should contain the specified labels $l_1, \cdots, l_k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/example-graph.png}
        \caption{Example Graph.}
        \label{fig:example-graph}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\linewidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/example-graph.png}
        \caption{Formal Definition of Example Graph.}
        \label{fig:example-graph-def}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Definition of an example graph.}
    \label{fig:example-graph-full}
\end{figure*}

\begin{example}
    Suppose property graph $G = (V, E, \lambda, L, T, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{T}, P_v, P_e)$ represents the relationships among persons.
    The property graph is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example-graph}.
    Then, to find all the persons with label \text{Student}, the corresponding expression is:
    \begin{equation*}
        \bigcirc_{(v_1\text{:Person})}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}


\subsubsection{Selection}

The selection operator is used to filter out the records that do not satisfy the specified constraints.
The formal definition of the selection operator is as follows.

\begin{definition}
    The selection operator is a mapping $\sigma_d : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{J}$, where $d$ represents the constraints the resultant records should satisfy.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    To find all the students whose name is ``Bob'', the following expression can be used:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sigma_{v_1.\text{name} = ``Bob''}\bigcirc_{(v_1\text{:Student})}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Projection}
The projection operator bridges the gap between graphs and tables, which make it possible to combine graph and relational queries.
Its formal definition is as follows.

\begin{definition}
    The projection operator is a mapping $\pi : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{J}$, which maps vertices and edges to a subset of them or their properties, and maps other attributes to a subset of them.
\end{definition}

Please note that if the resultant records of a projection operator cannot contain any vertex or edge, then it is called a flatten projection operator $\hat{\pi} : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{J}_D$.
A flatten projection operator can convert a property graph to a relational table.

\begin{example}
    Suppose we are going to get a relational table of persons, and the schema of the table is (name, age).
    Then, the following expression can achieve the goal.
    \begin{equation*}
        \pi_{v.name, v.age}(\bigcirc_{(v:Person)}).
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Expand}

The expand operator gets the edges adjacent to the given vertices.
Based on the direction of the expansion, the expand operator can be categorized into three types, i.e., expand-out ($\uparrow$), expand-in ($\downarrow$), and expand-both ($\updownarrow$).
For simplicity, the definition of the expand-both operator is given as follows, and those of expand-out and expand-in are similar.

\begin{definition}
    The expand-both operator is a mapping $\updownarrow_{(v)}^{(w:L)}[e] : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{J}$.
    For each record $c$ containing vertex $v$ and each edge $e$ satisfying $\lambda(e) = (v, w)$ (or $\lambda(e) = (w, v)$), a new record is created by appending ($e$, $w$) to $c$.
\end{definition}
 
\begin{example}
    To get all the ``Teaching''' relationships between students and teachers, the following expression can be used:
    \begin{equation*}
        \downarrow_{(v)}^{(v_t\text{:Teacher})}[\text{:Teaching}]\bigcirc_{(v\text{:Student})}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Join}

The join operator can join two relational tables or join two property graphs.
Similar to that in relational algebra, the join operator in graph relational algebra also has many types, such as natural join ($\Join$), left-outer join, and right-outer join.
For simplicity, the definition of natural join is proposed, and those of other types of joins is similar.

\begin{definition}
    The natural join operator $\Join : \mathcal{J} \times \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{J}$ combines two relations if they have the same values on common attributes.
\end{definition}

The natural join operator can be expressed as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        & R \Join P = \sigma_{R.a_1 = P.a_1 \land \cdots \land R.a_k = P.a_k}(R \times P), \\
        & \hspace{2em} \text{where } \text{attr(sch($R$))} \cap \text{attr(sch($P$))} = \{a_1, \cdots, a_k\}
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
    To obtain the names of the teachers who teach the common friends of Alice and Bob, the following expression can be used:
    \begin{equation*}
        \footnotesize
        \begin{split}
            & \pi_{v_3\text{.name}}( \\
            & \hspace{1em} (\downarrow_{(v_c)}^{(v_3\text{:Person})}[\text{:Teaching}]\updownarrow_{(v_1)}^{(v_c\text{:Person})}[\text{:Friend}]\sigma_{v_1\text{.name=``Alice''}}(\bigcirc_{(v_1\text{:Person})})) \\
            & \hspace{1em} \Join (\updownarrow_{(v_2)}^{(v_c\text{:Person})}[\text{:Friend}]\sigma_{v_2\text{.name=``Bob''}}(\bigcirc_{(v_2\text{:Person})}))\\ 
            & )
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Aggregation}
The aggregation operator groups the records according to the values of the specified attributes, and output new records that may contain aggregated values.
The aggregation operator is denoted by $\gamma_{c_1, \cdots, c_i}^{o_1, \cdots, o_j}$.
Specifically, the records are grouped according to attributes $c_1, \cdots, c_i \in V \cup E \cup D$, and $o_1, \cdots, o_j$ are the outputed new attributes.

\begin{example}
    To count the number of students teached by David, the following expression can be used:
    \begin{equation*}
        \downarrow_{(v_1)}^{(v_s:Student)}[\text{:Teaching}]\sigma_{v_1\text{.name=``David''}}(\bigcirc_{(v_1:Person)})
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Sorting and Top}

The sort operator $\tau_{* a_1, \cdots, * a_n}$ is used to sort the input graph relation according to attributes $a_1, \cdots, a_n \in D$.
Specifically, `*' can be $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, representing sorting the records ascendingly or descendingly, respectively.
The results of the sort operator are put in an ordered list rather than a bag.

The top operator $\lambda_k^s$ skips the first $s$ records in the input list, and return the next $k$ records as the outputs.
Since the \emph{bag} semantics are applied in graph relations, the records are unsorted by default and the top operator is meaningless in such bags. 
Therefore, the sort operator is usually applied before the top operator is used.

\begin{example}
    To obtain the most aged five teachers, the utilized expression can be as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda_{0}^{5}\tau_{\downarrow \text{age}}(\bigcirc_{(v_1\text{:Teacher})})
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}


\subsubsection{Unwind}

Given a graph relation $R$, suppose attribute $xs \in \text{attr}(\text{sch}(R))$ is a list.
Then, for each record $r$ in $R$, the unwind operator appends each value in $r.x$ to $r$ respectively and removes attribute $xs$ from $r$ to generate new records.
The formal definition of the unwind operator is as follows.

\begin{definition}
    Given graph relation $R$ with $\text{sch}(R) = (a_1, \cdots, a_n)$.
    Without loss of generality, suppose the value of attribute $a_1$ is of list type.
    Then, we have $\text{sch}(\omega_{a_1 \rightarrow a_s}(R)) = (a_2, \cdots, a_n, a_s)$.
    For each record $(val_1, \cdots, val_n) \in R$ with $val_1 = [l_1, \cdots, l_k]$,  $k$ new records are generated, where $r'_j = (val_2, \cdots, val_n, l_j)$, $j \in \{1, \cdots, k\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    To get all the classes taught by David, the following expression can be used:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \pi_{\text{course}}(\omega_{\text{curriculum} \rightarrow \text{course}}(\sigma_{v_1\text{.name=``David''}}(\bigcirc_{(v_1\text{:Person})}))).
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}


According to SQL/PGQ, the outputs of graph queries should be a relation consisting of property values, identifiers, labels or types.
References to vertices or edges should not be returned by graph queries.
Therefore, the outputs of the graph relational algebra are projected and flattened with the project and unwind operator, respectively.
Then, the output graph relation is converted to a relation over a relational schema, and can be involved in the following optimization of relational optimizer.

\subsection{Equivalence Between Graph Pattern Matching and Graph Relational Operators}

Given a SQL/PGQ query like 
\begin{lstlisting}
    SELECT * 
    FROM GRAPH_TABLE (graph_view
        MATCH <Pattern>
        COLUMNS (
            ...
        )
    );
\end{lstlisting}
the graph query part is expressed with the corresponding graph relational algebra expression with operators such as source, expand, join, and extend-intersect operators, and the logical plan can be generated.
However, the equivalence between the graph relational algebra expression and the graph query is not obvious.
Since the logical plan is finally transformed to a physical plan, which is executed with relational databases, the graph operators for pattern matching such as expand and extend-intersect are indeed implemented with joins.
Therefore, it is necessary to prove that the graph query is the same as its corresponding graph relational algebra expression.

Specifically, <Pattern> specified in the graph query is a list of path patterns, and for each path pattern, a path mode can be given.
In SQL/PGQ, the path mode can be WALK (by default), TRAIL, ACYCLIC, or SIMPLE.
Under the WALK mode, vertices and edges can repeated in the returned results.
Under the TRAIL and ACYCLIC mode, results with repeated edges and vertices are not returned respectively.
Under the SIMPLE mode, results with repeated vertices are not returned, unless these repeated vertices are the first and last vertices in the path (i.e., the path forms a circle).

We start from the case that there is only one path pattern specified in the <Pattern> part, and firstly, we focus on the WALK path mode.
In this mode, paths homomorphic to the path pattern are returned as the results.
Then, we have the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
    Matching a path pattern in WALK mode have the same meanings as the corresponding graph relational algebra expression. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The graph relational algebra operators related to pattern matching in SQL/PGQ include source, expand, join, and extend-intersect operators.
    Then, we prove the theorem by induction.
    Let each vertex and edge in a path pattern be an element.
    If for each edge in a pattern, its adjacent vertices are also in the pattern, then the pattern is called a strict pattern $P$.
    Otherwise, it is a loose pattern $\hat{P}$.

    Since path patterns specified in SQL/PGQ are all strict patterns, the induction is conducted on the numnber of elements in the strict pattern.
    When there is only one element (i.e., a vertex like ``(u:Label)'') in the pattern, the corresponding algebra expression of the pattern is $\bigcirc_{(u:\text{Label})}$, and it is clear that the expression equals the pattern.

    Then, suppose for a path pattern with at most $n$ elements, the corresponding algebra expressions have the same meaning as matching the path pattern.
    Denote a graph relational algebra with the same meaning as matching path pattern $P$ by $E_p$.
    
    When there are $n + 1$ elements in the path pattern $P$:
    
    %Condition 1: $P = P_1, P_2$, i.e., pattern $P$ is obtained by concatenating subpatterns $P_1$ and $P_2$.
    %(e.g., $P_1 = (u)-[e]-(v), P_2 = (u)-[e']-(w), P = (u)-[e]-(v), (u)-[e']-(w)$).
    %Then, $E_{p_1} \Join E_{p_2}$ equals $P$, since join operator implemented in relational databases follows the semantics of homomorphism.


    Condition 1: $P = P_1 - \hat{P}_2$.
    Without loss of generality, suppose vertex $v$ in $P_1$ is adjacent to an edge in $P_2$.
    (e.g., $P_1 = (u)-[e]-(v), P_2 = [e']-(w), P = (u)-[e]-(v)-[e']-(w)$).
    Then, let $P_3 = (v)-\hat{P}_2$, and the corrsponding algebra expression of $P$ can be $E_{p_1} \Join E_{p_3}$.
    $E_{p_1} \Join E_{p_3}$ equals $P$, since join operator implemented in relational databases follows the semantics of homomorphism.
    Moreover, if $\hat{P}_2$ only consists of one vertex and an edge adjacent to it (i.e., $\hat{P}_2 = [e:eLabel]-(v_t:vLabel)$).
    Then, the corresponding algebra expression of $P$ can also be $\updownarrow_{(v)}^{(v_t:vLabel)}[e:eLabel]E_{p_1}$.
    The expand operator is also implemented by joining relational tables, which follows the semantics of homomorphism.

    Condition 2: $P = P_1$ extends $v$ through edges $e_1:eLabel1, \cdots e_k:eLabelk$ ($k \geq 1$), i.e., at least one vertex in $P_1$ connects to vertex $v$.
    Then, the corresponding algebra expression of $P$ is 
    \begin{equation*}
        E_{p_1} \Diamond_{v_1, \cdots, v_k}^{eLabel1, \cdots, eLabelk} \bigcirc_{(v:vLabel)}.
    \end{equation*}
    Since the extend-intersect operator is implemented with relational joins and follows the semantics of homomorphism, the algebra expression has the same meaning as matching the path pattern.

    In conclusion, the corresponding algebra expressions of path pattern $P$ with $n + 1$ elements have the same meaning as matching the path pattern.

    In conclusion, in the WALK mode, matching path patterns has the same meaning as the corresponding graph relational algebra expressions.
\end{proof}


Besides the WALK mode by default, when the path patterns are in TRAIL, ACYCLIC, or SIMPLE mode, we still have the same conclusions.
Specifically, in TRAIL, ACYCLIC, or SIMPLE mode, a selection operator needs to be added to remove the results with repeated edges or vertices.
In detail, the selection operator should wrap the corresponding algebra expression of path patterns in the WALK mode.
For example, in the TRAIL mode, the corresponding graph relational algebra expression of $P = P_1 - P_2$ is $\sigma_{c}(E_{p_1} \Join E_{p_2})$ or $\sigma_{c}(\updownarrow_{(v)}^{(v_t:vLabel)}[e:eLabel]E_{p_1})$, where $c$ is the condition specifying that every two different pattern edges bind to different edges in each result.
In the ACYCLIC and SIMPLE mode, condition $c$ should be specified according to the constraints of the mode.

Furthermore, there may be more than one path patterns specified in the <Pattern> part of SQL/PGQ queries, and the different path patterns may have different path modes.
Denote the path patterns by $P_1, \cdots, P_k$.
According to SQL/PGQ, the binding results of different path patterns are joined together.
If the match mode in SQL/PGQ is set to \textbf{REPEATABLE ELEMENTS}, there is no more constraint, and ``MATCH $P_1, \cdots, P_k$'' has the same meaning as $P_1 \Join \cdots \Join P_k$, both of which have the semantics of homomorphism.
Otherwise, if the match mode in SQL/PGQ is set to \textbf{DIFFERENT EDGES}, the same edge cannot bind to different variables in different path patterns.
Therefore, a selection operator is needed, and ``MATCH $P_1, \cdots, P_k$'' has the same meaning as $\sigma_{d}(P_1 \Join \cdot \Join P_k)$, where $d$ is the condition specifying that each edge cannot bind to more than one variables across all path patterns.
