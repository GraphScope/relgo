In this paper, we propose a converged graph relational optimization framework named relgo for SQL/PGQ queries.
In detail, since optimizing graph queries with graph optimizers have exponentially better efficiency that than with relational optimizers, relgo optimizes the relational queries and graph queries in SQL/PGQ queries with a relational optimization module and a graph optimization module, respectively.
Besides, relgo utilizes optimization rules that optimizes queries across the relational and graph queries (e.g., \filterrule) to further improve the efficiency, and introduces a new operator (i.e., the extend-intersect operator) to speed up queries containing cycles.
The experiemntal results demonstrate the superior performance of relgo and show the effectiveness of the optimization rules as well as the extend-intersect operator.
In the future, we will attempt to connect relgo to more commonly-used backend databases and design more useful optimization rules across relational and graph queries.
