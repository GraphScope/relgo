\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we introduce \name, a converged relational-graph optimization framework designed for SQL/PGQ queries. We formulate the \spjm query skeleton to better analyze and optimize the relational-graph hybrid queries introduced by SQL/PGQ. After discovering that a graph-agnostic approach can result in a larger search space and suboptimal query plans, we design \name to optimize the relational and graph components of \spjm queries using dedicated relational and graph optimization modules, respectively. Additionally, \name incorporates optimization rules, such as \filterrule, which optimize queries across the relational and graph components, further enhancing overall query efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of \name against graph-agnostic baselines, demonstrating its superior performance and confirming the effectiveness of the proposed optimization techniques. Future work includes integrating \name with more widely-used backend databases to expand its applicability and impact.
