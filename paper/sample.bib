In this paper, we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs, containing a given query graph, from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraph isomorphism is generally NP-hard, most of the existing techniques are based on the framework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequently various novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniques work well for small query graphs, the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when the query graph size increases. Motivated by this, in the paper we firstly propose a novel and efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism, QuickSI. Secondly, we develop a new feature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our extensive experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed techniques, which significantly improve the existing techniques.},

  abstract  = {Given a query graph q and a data graph g, the subgraph isomorphism search finds all occurrences of q in g and is considered one of the most fundamental query types for many real applications. While this problem belongs to NP-hard, many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets. However, a recent study has shown, through an extensive benchmark with various real datasets, that all existing algorithms have serious problems in their matching order selection. Furthermore, all algorithms blindly permutate all possible mappings for query vertices, often leading to useless computations. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust subgraph search solution, called TurboISO, which is turbo-charged with two novel concepts, candidate region exploration and the combine and permute strategy (in short, Comb/Perm). The candidate region exploration identifies on-the-fly candidate subgraphs (i.e, candidate regions), which contain embeddings, and computes a robust matching order for each candidate region explored. The Comb/Perm strategy exploits the novel concept of the neighborhood equivalence class (NEC). Each query vertex in the same NEC has identically matching data vertices. During subgraph isomorphism search, Comb/Perm generates only combinations for each NEC instead of permutating all possible enumerations. Thus, if a chosen combination is determined to not contribute to a complete solution, all possible permutations for that combination will be safely pruned. Extensive experiments with many real datasets show that TurboISO consistently and significantly outperforms all competitors by up to several orders of magnitude.},
