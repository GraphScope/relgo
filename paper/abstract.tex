    The SQL/Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) language has been proposed to query relational data using both relational and graph operations. However, there is a significant gap in optimizing SQL/PGQ queries within a relational database, which we aim to address in this paper. We begin by extending the well-studied \spj (Select-Project-Join) queries to \spjm queries, which include an additional matching operator for representing graph pattern matching in SQL/PGQ. Although \spjm queries can be converted to \spj queries and optimized using existing relational query optimizers, our analysis shows that such a graph-agnostic method fails to benefit from graph-specific optimization techniques found in the literature. To address this issue, we develop a converged relational/graph optimization framework called \name for optimizing \spjm queries, leveraging joint efforts from both relational and graph query optimizations. Using DuckDB as the underlying relational execution engine, the end-to-end experiments demonstrate that \name can produce execution plans for \spjm queries that run up to $20$ times faster than the graph-agnostic method.
    %Besides, the experimental results of ablation studies illustrate the efficiency of \expandintersect.
